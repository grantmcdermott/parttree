Description: Visualize the partitions of simple decision trees, involving one or
    two predictors, on the scale of the original data. Provides an intuitive
    alternative to traditional tree diagrams, by visualizing how a decision tree
    divides the predictor space in a simple 2D plot alongside the original data.
    The 'parttree' package supports both classification and regression trees
    from 'rpart' and 'partykit', as well as trees produced by popular frontend
    systems like 'tidymodels' and 'mlr3'. Visualization methods are provided for
    both base R graphics and 'ggplot2'.
